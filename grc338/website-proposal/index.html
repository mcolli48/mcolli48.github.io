            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>Mikey's Fudge Kitchen </p><!--Change it to the name of the company-->
            
            <p>Mikey’s Fudge Kitchen is a small shop that sells several flavors of homemade fudge. It is made traditionally, with a marble slab to fold the fudge and control its temperature. The product is made fresh daily, weighed, and hand-packaged. The store offers free samples, half-pound slab boxes, and combined-flavor boxes. Online, one can order the half-pound slab boxes or combined-flavor boxes, for shipping anywhere in the US.</p><!--Short description of the company-->
            
            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p>Individuals visiting this site are often interested in ordering a gift for loved ones, especially around birthdays and holidays. Our product gets traction essentially year-round, but customers are often interested in buying our fudge as a treat in the Summer and around the Winter holidays. The site should be easy to follow and understand, so that the user can purchase and order fudge to their desired location efficiently.</p><!-- Who are the people who use this site? -->

                    <p>Our Story</p>
                    <p>[photograph of workers outside of the store on opening day]</p>
                    <p>Mikey’s Fudge Kitchen was created by Michaela Collins in the Winter of 2026. She had previously worked at a fudge business on an island on Lake Superior in Wisconsin for two summers, where she helped build their business from the ground-up, and write their flavor recipes. She fell in love with the work, and wanted to learn more.</p>
                    <p>During the off-season, she made fudge from home, tested more recipes, and researched traditional fudge-making methods. Her location in Wisconsin did not have the resources for marble slabs, and rather made the fudge in eight-pound batches in a large stirring and heating machine. However, she wanted to explore the idea of handmade fudge using marble slabs to prepare it, and her vision came.</p>
                    <p>She began preparation to open her own fudge shoppe in November of 2025, and by February 2026, they were up and running. The business has been lucky to be so successful so far, as San Luis Obispo did not have a dedicated fudge store. Stop by or order online to continue supporting this small handmade fudge business!</p>
